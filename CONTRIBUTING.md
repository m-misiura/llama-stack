# Contributing to Llama-Stack
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Discussions -> Issues -> Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. However, please read the following. This is heavily inspired by [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If in doubt, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack/discussions); we can always convert that to an issue later.

**I'd like to contribute!**

All issues are actionable (please report if they are not.) Pick one and start working on it. Thank you.
If you need help or guidance, comment on the issue. Issues that are extra friendly to new contributors are tagged with "contributor friendly".

**I have a bug!**

1. Search the issue tracker and discussions for similar issues.
2. If you don't have steps to reproduce, open a discussion.
3. If you have steps to reproduce, open an issue.

**I have an idea for a feature!**

1. Open a discussion.

**I've implemented a feature!**

1. If there is an issue for the feature, open a pull request.
2. If there is no issue, open a discussion and link to your branch.

**I have a question!**

1. Open a discussion or use [Discord](https://discord.gg/llama-stack).


**Opening a Pull Request**

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints using `pre-commit`.
5. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
6. Ensure your pull request follows the [conventional commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Meta's open source projects.

Complete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Meta has a [bounty program](http://facebook.com/whitehat/info) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.


## Set up your development environment

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage python dependencies and virtual environments.
You can install `uv` by following this [guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
$ cd llama-stack
$ uv sync --extra dev
$ uv pip install -e .
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting and formatting checks on your code. You can install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```bash
$ uv run pre-commit install
```

After that, pre-commit hooks will run automatically before each commit.

Alternatively, if you don't want to install the pre-commit hooks, you can run the checks manually by running:

```bash
$ uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Before pushing your changes, make sure that the pre-commit hooks have passed successfully.

## Adding a new dependency to the project

To add a new dependency to the project, you can use the `uv` command. For example, to add `foo` to the project, you can run:

```bash
$ uv add foo
$ uv sync
```

## Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length
* ...

## Common Tasks

Some tips about common tasks you work on while contributing to Llama Stack:

### Using `llama stack build`

Building a stack image (conda / docker) will use the production version of the `llama-stack`, `llama-models` and `llama-stack-client` packages. If you are developing with a llama-stack repository checked out and need your code to be reflected in the stack image, set `LLAMA_STACK_DIR` and `LLAMA_MODELS_DIR` to the appropriate checked out directories when running any of the `llama` CLI commands.

Example:
```bash
$ cd work/
$ git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack.git
$ git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models.git
$ cd llama-stack
$ LLAMA_STACK_DIR=$(pwd) LLAMA_MODELS_DIR=../llama-models llama stack build --template <...>
```


### Updating Provider Configurations

If you have made changes to a provider's configuration in any form (introducing a new config key, or changing models, etc.), you should run `python llama_stack/scripts/distro_codegen.py` to re-generate various YAML files as well as the documentation. You should not change `docs/source/.../distributions/` files manually as they are auto-generated.

### Building the Documentation

If you are making changes to the documentation at [https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can use the following command to build the documentation and preview your changes. You will need [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and the readthedocs theme.

```bash
$ cd llama-stack/docs
$ uv sync --extra docs

# This will start a local server (usually at http://127.0.0.1:8000) that automatically rebuilds and refreshes when you make changes to the documentation.
$ make html
$ uv run sphinx-autobuild source build/html
```
